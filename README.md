## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for my "Sales Data Analysis" interactive dashboard project, which I completed during my Data Analyst Internship at MeriSkill. This project leverages PowerBI to transform and visualize sales data, providing valuable insights for data-driven decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: The PowerBI dashboard provides an interactive interface for exploring sales data and gaining insights.

- **Real-time Data**: The dashboard updates in real-time, ensuring that decision-makers always have access to the most up-to-date information.

- **Sales Performance**: Track key sales metrics, including revenue, sales growth, and product-level insights.

- **Customer Segmentation**: Understand customer demographics and behaviors to tailor marketing strategies.

- **Time Series Analysis**: Identify trends and seasonality patterns to inform inventory management and marketing campaigns.
